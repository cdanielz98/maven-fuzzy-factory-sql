# SQL Project- Maven Fuzzy Factory
A course-based project split into two parts.

## The Situation
You've just been hired as an eCommerce Database Analyst for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an online retailer which has just launched their first product.
## The  Brief
As a member of the startup team, you will work with the CEO, the Marketing Director, and the Website Manager to help steer the business.
You will analyse and optimise marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact if new product launches.

## Part 1
1. Gsearch seems to the the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase the growth there?

Both sessions and orders have been increasing monthly.

2. Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.

Nonbrand campaigns are bringing in significantly more sessions and orders than brand campaigns.

3. While we're on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand and pull monthly sessions and device type? I want to show the board we really know our traffic sources.

There were far more desktop sessions than mobile sessions, and number of sessions from both device types increased monthly.

4. I'm worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % traffic from Gsearch. Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each other channel?
